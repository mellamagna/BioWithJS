                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I am Mel Lamagna, an aspiring software developer based in Jersey City, NJ. I've graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2017, with the majority of my coursework having focused on Java and C.</p>

                <p>I am quite experienced with the effective use of scripting in order to solve problems such as employee efficiency&mdash;In August 2018, having gained experience with a former employer's Telnet terminal emulation software of choice (PowerTerm by Ericom Software) as well as its proprietary scripting language, I was able to develop a script that was able to streamline the current data entry process, effectively cutting the number of keystrokes a user would have to make in half and raising the productivity statistics within the data entry department once the script was distributed to the 20+ operators throughout the station.</p>

                <p>I have a deep interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning and hope to specialize in these areas of the field one day.</p>
